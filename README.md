# About This Project

The following project provides support for sending inputs to Sonic Heroes using Reloaded's own controller library, sometimes known as the `Reloaded Input Stack`.

## How to Use

A. Install Heroes-Controller-Hook like a regular Reloaded mod.
B. Setup your individual controllers and input devices inside Reloaded's Launcher

C. Modify `PlayerOne.json` and/or the other player files inside the mod directory to rebind keys, if necessary.

If `PlayerOne.json` does not exist, please launch the game with the mod enabled - it will be autogenerated.

## Feature Set

### Remapping

The following is a snipped from the config files.
These map the buttons of a virtual Reloaded controller to actions.

```
"ControllerPort": 0,
"Jump": "ButtonA",
"Action": "ButtonB",
"FormationL": "ButtonY",
"FormationR": "ButtonX",
"CameraL": "ButtonLb",
"CameraR": "ButtonRb",
"TeamBlast": "ButtonBack",
"Start": "ButtonStart",
"DpadUp": "DpadUp",
"DpadDown": "DpadDown",
"DpadLeft": "DpadLeft",
"DpadRight": "DpadRight",

/*
    (This file is autogenerated)
    ControllerPort: Defines which Reloaded controller slot/number to read from.

    Available Buttons:
    ButtonA
    ButtonB
    ButtonX
    ButtonY
    ButtonLb
    ButtonRb
    ButtonBack
    ButtonStart
    ButtonLs
    ButtonRs
    ButtonGuide
    DpadUp
    DpadLeft
    DpadRight
    DpadDown
*/
```

#### Trigger Options
```
"TriggerOptions": {
  "EnableTriggerRotation": true,
  "SwapTriggers": false
}
```

Any other possible necessities/features such as button to trigger, deadzone support are already provided inside Reloaded's launcher.

### Four Player Support
In the PC port of the game; the game only and supplies the information for two players.

What you may or may not know, is that the game under the hood supports 4 peripherals/player inputs, and even 4 player, 4 tea, gameplay (although that is broken and will crash the game).

The debug functionalities of the game, such as the "Easy Menu/EASY_SELECT" are also known to make use of those extra controllers. The mod has been verified to correctly send inputs to those otherwise unused controller slots using said debug functionality.

It is entirely possible that using this mod you may find otherwise not yet found debug functionality.
